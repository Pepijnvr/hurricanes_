            <h1>Houston</h1><p>
Houston is coastal city with approximately 2,293,288 citizens in 2021 which makes it the fourth biggest city in the United States on terms of populace (Texas demographics, 2021). It is connected to the Buffalo Bayou river that ends in a lagoon named Galveston bay.
Houston has been hit several times by hurricanes but in 2017 hurricane Harvey flooded the entire city. Hurricane Harvey killed approximatly 70 people in Houston alone (Jonkman et al, 2018). That is not the only thing because Houston is also home to one of the biggest petrochemical industry of the world so Harvey also caused environmental damage.

          <h2>Economy</h2>
          <p>Houston has one of the biggest petrochemical industry in the world. There are 618 active chemical manufacturing establishments with more than 39,700 employees (greater partnership Houston, 2020). Furthermore Houston has 44.0 percent of the nation’s base petrochemical capacity. Besides that Houston is home to 44 of the nation’s 113 publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production firms (greater partnership Houston, 2021). This means that Houston is essential to both the economy- as the energy supply of the united states.</p>

          <h2>Evacuation plan</h2>
          <p>The evacuation plan in Houston was notably not issued in Houston right away (Goodie et al, 2019)  and this was a disaster considering how flat Houston is. This means that the city is very vulnerable to flooding and during hurricane Harvey it happened. The mayor of Houston, Turner, did not evacuate on purpose because of the following reason he explained in a press conference: “You literally cannot put 6.5 million people on the road, If you think the situation right now is bad, you give an order to evacuate, you are creating a nightmare.” (Turner, 2017)

            Many people were already experiencing this nightmare because when the citizens of Houston woke up they found themselves in a flooded house with no way out. Besides that they were unable to receive aid from emergency services. (CNN, 2017) <br/> <br/>
            
            A study in 2019 showed that Houston-Galveston MSA (Metropolitan statistical area) a shelter deficit of 353.137 persons has. In other words, the shelter capacity in the area would only meet 21% of the shelter demand. Therefore, improving the shelter capacity in the Houston–Galveston MSA would not only entail eliminating preexisting deficits, but the strategic construction of the facilities in higher demand areas particularly as both populations and risks from tropical storms increase in the region (Karaye et al, 2020)</p>

          <h2>Environmental</h2>
          <p>Harris County is home to one of the worlds largest petrochemical complexes. there are close to a 1000 metal manufacturing and handling facilities registered in Houston. Besides that there are 13 active Superfund sites in Harris County contaminated with organic compounds and heavy metals among other chemicals (Han et al, 2022). <br/> <br/>That means that when there is a hurricane there is a chance that these chemicals will flow to residential zones which will possibly harm people in the area.

            This is not specifically a risk during the hurricane but rather when the hurricane is over. Flooding could introduce new exposure pathways which contaminates the soil and can harm children (Kiaghadi et al, 2022).
