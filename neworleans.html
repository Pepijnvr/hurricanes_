            <h1>New-Orleans</h1><p>
                New Orleans is coastal city with approximately 396,048 citizens. It is connected to the Mississippi river and this makes it vulnerable to flooding but also gives the city an important economic role.  Furthermore the city has been hit by hurricane Katrina which had a severe impact on the city water protection policy. After hurricane Katrina everyone saw how vulnerable they were and that needed to change.

          <h2>Economy</h2>
          <p>New Orleans has always been an important commercial center in the united states mainly because of its busy harbor. It exports; metals, chemicals, textiles, oils but most importantly New Orleans is a major grain port both in the United states and worldwide (Jackson, 2023 ). 

            According to a report published in 2017 by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, the port of New Orleans supports an estimate of 437.000 jobs. Furthermore the report says that this port alone generates over 100.3 billion dollars in economic activity each year (Ryan, 2017). This means that the port of New Orleans important is for the world economy and it would be very bad if it gets out of business because of a hurricane.</p>

          <h2>Evacuation plan</h2>
          <p>New-Orleans’s evacuation plan was put to the test in 2004 when Katrina hit the coast and it failed. The warnings were not urgent enough and the government was not well enough prepared to evacuate the population. In the last hours before the storm would arrive the government organized public transit buses to pick up people but because the government was forced to use commercial vehicles low income people were left behind. (Almutairi, 2022)

            the new evacuation plan is designed to move 10% of the city residents which is approximately 35.000-40.000 people. It lasts 72 hours or more where the evacuees are expected to be out of town within the first 30 hours before a hurricane hits the coast. The effectiveness of this plan is questioned in cases where people choose to stay behind in spite of the warnings. This may lead to more deaths because the government may not be able to do anything for them. (Almutairi, 2022)

          <h2>Katrina</h2>
          <p>Storm Katrina was a tropical storm that hit the coast of New-Orleans at the 29 of august in 2005 (NWD, ZD). It killed 1392 people in New Orleans and 341 in Louisiana (fox8live, 2023). Katrina went over New Orleans with a surface speed of around 115mph (183,47 km/h) and different parts of New Orleans received 14 inches (35,56 cm) of rainfall (Lewis, 2021). Estimated damages from Katrina are close to 200 billion dollars (Congleton, 2006).

            After Hurricane Katrina hit, congress decided to invest billions of dollars to build pumps, dikes and floodwalls to withstand a “100 year storm”. This policy may well have saved New Orleans on the 4th of September in 2021 when hurricane Ida struck the coast. The defenses that were build post Katrina saved countless lives. (Garza, 2021)
